        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>Cricket is fun. It was played first in England. In Cricket we use a bat, a ball and 2 sets of wickets. In one set of wickets there are 3 stumps. Each stump has a name. There is the leg stump, middle stump and the off stump. in each team there are 11 players playing in each match. The team batting first sets the score and the other team has to try and beat it to win the match. Each team has 10 wickets to spare and 2 batsmen bat at a time. 1 is a runner and the other person is on strike. the person on strike is the person who wits the ball with the bat. </p>
